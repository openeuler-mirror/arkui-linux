 *   SubscribedAbstractProperty<T> is the return type of

 *   - LocalStorage methods link(), prop(), setAndLink(), and setAndProp()
 *
 *   'T' can be boolean, string, number or custom class.
 * 
 * Main functions
 *   @see get() reads the linked AppStorage/LocalStorage property value,
 *   @see set(newValue) write a new value to the synched AppStorage/LocalStorage property value
 *   @see aboutToBeDeleted() ends the sync relationship with the AppStorage/LocalStorage property
 *        The app must call this function before the SubscribedAbstractProperty<T> object 
 *        goes out of scope.
